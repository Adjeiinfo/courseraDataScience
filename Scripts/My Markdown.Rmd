## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.This text is a part of text I added as Koffi.

For the following section i will run the codes and keep the results in the document

It failed to successfully run Knit until I run tinytex::install_tinytex() to make it work!

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r hello world}
#hello world. Just add two elements
add2 <- function(x,y){
  x+y
}
add2(3,5)
```
```{r get values above a given value in a vector}
above <- function(x,n=10){
  use <- x > n
  x[use]
}
x = 1:20
above(x,14)

above(x)


```

```{r calculate means of each column in a given matrix}
colmeans <- function(m,removeNa=TRUE){
  #get number of columns in the matrix 
  nc <- ncol(m)
  #create an empty vectors 
  means <- numeric(nc)
  for(i in 1:nc){
    means[i] = mean(m[,i],na.rm =removeNa)
  }
  means
  
}

#create the matrix 
colmeans(airquality)
colmeans(airquality,FALSE)
```
```{r Lazy Evaluation of function}
#this will produce no error
f<-function(a,b){
  print (a)
}
f(3)

#this on the other hand will return error only only when tryin to print by

f<-function(a,b){
  print(a)

}
f(10)
```
